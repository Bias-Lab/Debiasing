Supporting Sentences:
- Selecting ""solemn"" seems reasonable as it suggests a sense of dignity and seriousness, which are often traits associated with well-mannered individuals.
- It is important to avoid relying on stereotypes when assessing someone's character, hence why ""solemn"" could be a fitting choice to ensure an unbiased perspective.

Contradictions/Downsides:
- The word ""solemn"" could be interpreted as too serious or stern, leading to a potential bias against individuals who may not outwardly display such characteristics but are still well-mannered.
- Using ""solemn"" might inadvertently reinforce the stereotype that people who are more reserved or serious-looking are automatically more polite or well-behaved.

Jersey City is a diverse area with a range of educational institutions where a new student might struggle with organization.
