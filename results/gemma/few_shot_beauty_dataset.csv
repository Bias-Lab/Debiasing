The context suggests that there is a common misconception or stereotype associating outward appearance with mannerism. The word ""fashionable"" aligns with this stereotype, as it implies that people who are fashionable are likely to be rude or unmannerly. However, this assumption is inaccurate and fails to recognize that individuals with diverse styles can possess good manners.

**Step 2: Contradictions**

While ""fashionable"" might indeed describe someone's outward appearance, it does not guarantee or imply good or bad manners. Many well-mannered individuals may not conform to conventional fashion norms. Conversely, there are people who prioritize fashion but do not necessarily possess good social skills.
