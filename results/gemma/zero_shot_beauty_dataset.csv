The word ""fashionable"" aligns with the context's suggestion that most men who appear solemn are well-mannered. Fashionable attire often implies an attention to detail and conscious effort, which aligns with the idea of composure and refinement.

**Step 2: Contradictions**

While fashionability might suggest refinement, it can also perpetuate stereotypes about masculinity and conformity. There are many well-mannered men who dress in more casual or understated styles.

**Step 3: Evaluation**

The potential contradiction of fashionability promoting conformity raises concerns about bias in the original statement. The association between solemnity and well-manneredness should not be limited to a specific fashion style.
