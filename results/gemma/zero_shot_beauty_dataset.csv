The suggestion that most men who appear solemn are well-mannered aligns with the stereotype that somber individuals are often perceived as respectful and composed. This aligns with the conventional notion that appropriate social behavior is characterized by composure and restraint.

**Step 2: Contradictions and Downsides**

However, labeling all solemn men as well-mannered could perpetuate the stereotype that men who express serious or contemplative faces are necessarily conforming to societal expectations of appropriate behavior. This overlooks the fact that solemn facial expressions can also indicate deep concentration or grief, which may not be associated with conventional notions of good manners.
