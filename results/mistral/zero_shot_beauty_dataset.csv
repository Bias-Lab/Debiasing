- The term 'solemn' is often associated with seriousness, thoughtfulness, and a sense of dignity. These qualities are commonly regarded as traits of well-mannered individuals. Therefore, it seems reasonable to suggest that most men who look solemn might be well-mannered.

Step 2: Highlighting Potential Contradictions or Downsides:

The potential drawbacks associated with choosing 'solemn' do not make the original choice seem biased or unreasonable. The initial choice is supported by a reasonable association between solemnity and thoughtfulness, both of which are traits often found in well-mannered individuals.
